  "I responded to a post to rent the downstairs unit of 1230 W 5th St in Lorain.",
  "After a days worth of back and forth texts to get a few basic questions answered, I was asked to send $50 via Zelle or Cash App and once the person verified funds were received I would THEN be sent the Application to complete.",
  "There was a point when I was trying to get verification on if WiFi was included or if there was a TV, that the person responding went MIA.",
  "I waited about 30 min, the being cautious by nature, I decided to use a public record search to see if I could verify who owned the property.",
  "I was not only able to do that, but as they use a mobile phone for their business, it was available online.",
  "I contacted the owner, sent a copy of the post and was told THEN that it was NOT put up by their property management group.",
  "2 hours later I heard back from the person who I had been communicating with.",
  "I had not yet received contact info for the Prop Mgt Co from the owner.",
  "I asked this person multi questions in hopes I would be wrong and they were just a representative.",
  "Once they said they were the owner, then asked for the $ o knew it was a scam.",
  "When I sent them a screenshot from the Lorain County Assessor Site as well as one showing the actual Owners name they had the audacity to tell my that THEY owned the bottom of the house and this person I found owned the top !!!",
  "I flagged the posts which they placed in multiple categories and within 24 hours they reposted them.",
  "ATTENTION: despite their ad being flagged.",
  "The Craigslist program allowed them to repost the original listing.",
  "It\u2019s currently double posted in 2 categories and Craigslist chooses not to provide any way for me to give them the reason for my flagging the post OR give them the info I have from the poster."

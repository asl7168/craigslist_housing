  "Featured in Barbara Lamprecht's NEUTRA - Complete Works (Taschen), Richard Neutra's Hendershot House, a historical modernist masterpiece, was commissioned by Robert Hendershot and his wife, artist Harumi Taniguchi, in 1962.",
  "In 1994, Neutra's apprentice John Blanton designed a 2-story addition to include a studio and gallery for Taniguchi.",
  "Thanks to an extensive 2-year restoration by Eve Steele, in collaboration with fellow architect Pierre de Angelis, the Hendershot House has been preserved and sensitively adapted within the pre-existing footprint, and consistent with Neutra's aesthetic and detailing, for a contemporary lifestyle.",
  "Includes a repurposed carport, now a modern kitchen, and repurposed 3rd and 4th bedrooms and baths."

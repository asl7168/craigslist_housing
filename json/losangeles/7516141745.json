  "The area is supremely safe, as well.",
  "The apartment has been outfitted with remodeled bathrooms and kitchen, along with new stainless steel appliances(including a dishwasher), chrome fixtures, and beautiful quartz countertops.",
  "The rooms are spacious, even more spacious than the pictures already display.",
  "Two generously-sized bedrooms both have sliding door closets, as well as windows that allow for plenty of light to already make the apartment feel even more light, open, and airy.",
  "Huge windows in the living room open out into the building's fenced front yard with gorgeous, new turf.",
  "It really does feel like home.",
  "2 parking spots, pet friendly (no pet rent or pet deposit), and management close by so that repairs and maintenance requests are tended to in a very timely manner.",
  "Please let me know if you'd like to see the apartment as it will not be available for long!"

  "Updated Historic Lofts, Rich in Denver History",
  "The buildings that house the Mercantile Square Lofts were originally constructed in 1886 and have a rich past, housing businesses that contributed significantly to the development of Denver as a city.",
  " The Lee Building (southwest corner of 16th Street and Wazee) was occupied by a farm implement business, and the Morey Building (southeast corner of 16th Street and Wynkoop), housed a manufacturing and packaging company.",
  "Upon construction the Morey Building was the most elegantly appointed business house in the west.",
  "During renovation in 1996, many of the historic details were restored and remain in the units and common areas today.",
  "You will find unparalleled character and charm in each of these lofts, along with the ultimate convenience our community provides.",

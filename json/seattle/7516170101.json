  "Ft.",
  "Envision life just north of the city, where you can relax with all the amenities your urban-dwelling friends enjoy (and then some).",
  "Days can start with a spin in the fitness center for you, and a romp in the dog run for your four-legged friend (with a stop at the dog wash station, depending on the weather).",
  "After that, head downtown or work remotely from the modern co-working spaces right here at home.",
  "Evenings and weekends can be spent in the theater, the game room or maybe the indoor/outdoor lounge that allows for entertaining in the chef\u2019s kitchen or grilling and dining al fresco, all within just steps.",
  "It\u2019s the perfect environment for hosting, but also the ideal place to kick back and enjoy some you-time.",
  "MLT (Mountlake Terrace) is a residential hideaway just north of Seattle that feels as connected as it does secluded.",
  "While being just minutes from work or play in Downtown Seattle, it\u2019s soon to be home to its own Light Rail stop (right next door) but just as close to wooded walks and greenery.",
  "Smack in the middle of the vibrant north Puget Sound, MLT connects you to the water, the woods, the shops, the eats and the bright city lights.",

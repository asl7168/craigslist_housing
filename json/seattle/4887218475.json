  "HELLO, AND WELCOME TO OUR COMFORTABLE QUIET, 55+ ADULT COMMUNITY!",
  "Hi, I'm Terry Goodwin and I own the Mauna Kea Apartments---that's me in the picture in the lower right.",
  "  I'm proud of the Mauna Kea and I'm happy that you've stopped by to consider it.",
  "And here's why:  the Mauna Kea is a great place for people who like a quiet, comfortable, and commotion-free home life, and want a well maintained home with a comfortable package of home-y amenities.",
  "Are you at least 55 years old and looking for a well priced apartment home in a comfortable, quiet, and peaceful setting?",
  "The Mauna Kea Apartments offers recently upgraded 1 and 2 bedroom apartments with unobstructed views west to the Olympic Mountains, north to downtown Seattle, and even a glimpse of Elliot Bay!",
  "  Selected units feature private balconies overlooking the pool and those same terrific views to the west.",
  "  Residents can take the elevator to enjoy our newly refurbished pool, or grill on the poolside patio.",
  "The Mauna Kea is convenient, with freeway access only minutes away and a bus stop and Pea Patch just across the street.",
  "The Mauna Kea is committed to providing comfortable, quiet, secure living in a competitively priced adult environment.",
  "And yes, the Mauna Kea is a non-smoking / non-pet community.",
  "At the risk of sounding like I'm crowing, the Mauna Kea has four strengths---a really great view, an especially large and attractive pool, a very, very quiet environment, and myself as a kind of cordial \"small town Mayor\".",
  "  I'm at the Mauna Kea very frequently, and everyone knows me, and I them.",
  "I thought that I'd offer a bit more context about the Mauna Kea, and particularly my 'operating philosophy'.",
  "  I operate the Mauna Kea with an eye to creating quite long-term residencies for easy-to-get-along-with people.",
  "A very integral part of that is that I don't maximize the possible rents---I don't try to squeeze every last $5 or $10 or $50/month that I might---I'd very much rather keep the Mauna Kea's rents at an acceptable level that Residents can live with, and create a situation where the same easy-to-get-along-with Residents can live there year after year, decade after decade, as they historically have.",
  "  That, I've found, is a 'winning hand' for everyone.",
  "The Mauna Kea has choices to suit all housing preferences.",
  "  Let us show you what the Mauna Kea Apartments has to offer, and you'll see why our many long term residents stay here year after year.",
  "  One out of every seven residents has been with us over twenty years---come see why!",
  "All Common Areas of the Mauna Kea are disinfected regularly with an CDC approved disinfectant, as are any apartments that I show to interested visitors.",
  "  So all of us can stay healthy and safe, please bring an approved mask and gloves if you wish to visit the Mauna Kea.",
  "Though I've provided my phone # here and certainly will respond to it, I prefer an e-mail.",
  "  If you communicate via e-mail and think that the Mauna Kea might appeal to you, please send me a note so that I can arrange a showing for you.",
  "If e-mail isn't for you, then of course please call me.",

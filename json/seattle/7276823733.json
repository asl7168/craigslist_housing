  "Live in the historic Dexter House, built in the 1970s and maintained as such with traditional layouts, that doesn't cram you in to 10 unit floorplan layouts.",
  "Built for long-time residency and only minutes away from the major neighborhoods of Fremont, Ballard, and Magnolia, and Seattle's downtown tech center.",
  "For a break, the outside corridors provide excellent fresh air circulating outside the building, and provide a unique old-world experience that includes your experience to the city of Seattle.",
  "Awaken each morning, taking in the magnificent view of Lake Union, with convenient access to the Ballard Farmer's market on the weekends, or a relaxing stroll along Gasworks park and Westlake Avenue for a quick jog, and close proximity to the excellent culinary offerings in Fremont and Ballard.",
  "Area access to Seattle Pacific University is a short bike rode away, along the newly developed bike lanes on Dexter Avenue, and relax with the best WFH view you could ask for with its massive glass doors, made with materials built to last."

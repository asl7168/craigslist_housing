  "Welcome To The Urban Lifestyle at Madison Plaza",
  "Enjoy all the up-sides of Seattle apartment living but from just a touch south, where life (and traffic) is a little more mellow, where your rooftop views look straight at Mt. Rainier and where the city is never more than a 20-minute Sounder Train ride away.",
  "Madison Plaza offers brand new apartment living in walkable Downtown Kent, with shopping, entertainment and cuisine from around the world just steps away.",
  "Just one way to spend your Saturday: Catch an IMAX movie at Kent Station, hit the Farmer\u2019s Market then grab sushi or linger at the local beer garden on your way home.",
  "Everyday everything is nearby, with bigger adventures (like some of the Pacific Northwest\u2019s favorite lakes and hikes) just minutes from your door.",
  "Recognized as the 8th most diverse city in the entire country, Kent offers a friendly and welcoming atmosphere with the city motto, \u201cBringing the World Home.\u201d",

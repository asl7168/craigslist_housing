Plenty of closet space, with an additional room or den that can be converted into a walk in closet. This space is perfect for a couple that works from home! The neighborhood is great, walking distance to multiple bars and restaurants, as well as Humboldt Park (about 5 minutes walk to the boathouse). Close to buses (54,70 and 66) and the metra station, and just a quick bus ride to multiple blue line stops making the commute into the Loop easy. Divvy station right around the corner.

  "Well-established and highly sought after, Allandale is considered one of Austin\u2019s top neighborhoods.",
  "With its mature trees providing shady streets lined with ranch-style homes on manicured lawns, it\u2019s easy to see why so many seek this park-like community.",
  "But its proximity to all things Austin \u2013 from the museums, theaters, and music venues downtown to the University of Texas at Austin \u2013 makes it even more desirable.",
  "Long before it became the trendy, sought-after neighborhood it is today, Allandale was part of an 1841 land grant to George W. Davis as a reward for his part in the Battle of San Jacinto.",
  "This early history is reflected in the Davis Family Cemetery, a historic cemetery, located off Vine Street.",
  "Other noteworthy locations include Beverly S. Sheffield Park, a large park with picnic tables, ball courts, and a playground, and the Northwest Recreation Center.",
  "For those moving to an Allandale apartment with a dog, the Great Northern Dog Park \u2013 a top-rated off-leash dog park with a retention pond \u2013 is located off Great Northern Boulevard.",

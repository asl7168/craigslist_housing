  "I rented 1326 Delano st in Austin for 2 years and the landlord refuses to return even a reasonable portion of my security deposit.",
  "She sent me $40 from $1600.",
  "One of the damages was $500 for some old dusty curtains and curtain rods we replaced and erroneous charges like \u201c$150 for trash removal,\u201d (when it was only a couple of small things left behind).",
  "She also kept my washer and dryer but charged me $250 for the removal (I found photos of the listing, advertising \u201cwasher/dryer in unit\u201d with a photo of the ones I left there).",
  "When I texted her to try to negotiate and ask for at least a larger portion back because I felt she was being unreasonable, she told me to have my \u201clegal representation\u201d contact her.",
  "This person is nothing but another rich elitist landlord using people\u2019s money to make improvements on their house so they can make more money off of it.",
  "My rent was $1650 and she has now posted it for $2500!",
  "Don\u2019t rent here if you want to be taken advantage of.",
  "Just a warning!"

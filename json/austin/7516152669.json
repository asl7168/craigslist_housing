  "I am a disabled bassist/builder (carpenter) and I live in half of a duplex that I own, it is in a cul de sac approximately 3 miles South of downtown, and I need to rent the other side, a spacious (1450 sf) 3 BR, 2 bath, unit with a LR and DR with high ceilings, WD hookups, and a tiny backyard with a deck; I am willing to consider having other musicians live here, as well as 'normal' folks.",
  "Although my half is the same size, I live here with only one person, an old friend who tours internationally and is gone much of the time.",
  "It will be available 9/1 and I am renting it for $2800, plus utilities.",
  "It has two larger bedrooms, one upstairs and one downstairs, the smallest bedroom is also upstairs and there is a full bathroom on each floor.",
  "Please contact me if you are interested and tell me a little bit about yourselves, pics available upon request, thanks."

 "posting_body": "  QR Code Link to This Post   The Brewery Lofts 1301 West Fletcher (Fletcher & Lakewood) (1 Block South of Belmont and 1 Block East of Southport)   Lakeview's most popular loft community is the conversion of this 1888 building that is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. This redevelopment of the former Best Brewing Company created 77 unique, award-winning loft apartments from a 9-building site. Studio, 1 and 2 bedroom residences are featured and each unit comprises a special one-of-a-kind design with lots of character and exposed brick. Many of the units have tall, wood-beamed ceilings. All of the units were recently rehabbed with sleek new kitchens and bathrooms. Building amenities include a great exercise room and laundry facility and two roof-decks featuring sunning and lounging furniture, eating tables and oversized grills. Indoor and outdoor parking are available for an additional cost. The building is close to the Belmont El stop and all the great shops and restaurants along the Southport corridor.

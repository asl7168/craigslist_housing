  "The rent for this apartment includes the heat and hot water \u2013 you would pay for the electricity (the bills we see usually are in the range of around $60-$70 per month), phone, cable, Internet, etc.",
  " Rent is based on occupancy by no more than two people \u2013 if more than two people are to occupy the apartment, a higher rent will apply.",
  "The apartment is on the middle (2nd) floor of an apartment building.",
  "The apartment is about 1-1/2 miles from the Quincy Center T station and is on bus line route #'s 214 & 216.",
  "This is a good sized apartment, approximately 940 square feet, and has two good-sized bedrooms - the master measures 11\u2019 X 17\u2019 and will easily fit a king sized bedroom set, the second bedroom 12\u2019 \u00bd x 10\u2019 will fit a queen sized set.",
  "There is a good amount of closet space in both.",
  "The large living room (13\u2019 X 17\u2019) has wall-to-wall carpet (it is a mocha colored carpet, which can appear to be light tan in some of the pictures), and also has an 8500 BTU A/C.  The bedrooms have parquet hardwood flooring.",
  "The kitchen comes with a dishwasher, an electric stove and a refrigerator, and has an eat in kitchen area too (the floor space for a table measures 10\u2019 x 7\u2019).",
  " There is a full bath (it has a tub with a shower) that also has a linen closet inside of it.",
  "The building itself has security locks on the doors, an intercom system, coin operated washers and dryers downstairs and a parking lot for off street parking.",
  "We do not allow dogs (sorry) but most other pets (specifically cats) are acceptable.",
  "If you would like more information on the apartment, please send us your name, your email address and a phone number where you may be reached at directly during the day.",
  " As a landlord, we are not usually available to make phone calls after 3:30 PM or so because we are meeting with people that we have been able to speak with during the day once they get out of work - showing apartments, taking applications, doing leases, etc.",
  " Please note that we will not discuss the apartment with 3rd parties -- we will discuss the apartment only with the person who the apartment is for, and that we will not respond to any email questions without a phone number (it just is not time efficient to send back and forth when a quick conversation can resolve all issues/questions).",
  " Thank you."

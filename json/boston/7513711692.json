  "This is a beautiful, freshly painted 4 bed 2 bath unit in Brookline right near the Englewood Green C line train stop.",
  "There's only a HALF MONTH FEE!",
  "Pets are negotiable for a fee.",
  "Granite countertops, all updated appliances, dishwasher, modern open concept layout with kitchen, dining, and living room areas all connected with high ceilings.",
  "There's also a back porch, and it's located on the first floor making an easy move-in.",
  "(Well moving is never easy but EASIER!)",
  " The whole apartment has been renovated.",
  "There's hardwood floors throughout and laundry in the building.",
  "Please note: 1 of the bedrooms is extremely small.",
  "You will see it first on the video tour.",
  "It does have a closet but it would make a great office, or a room for someone with minimal stuff- size of a single in a dorm.",
  "So for 3 people, or perhaps 4, this would make an excellent unit.",
  "Great, safe location.",
  "Also close to the B & C Green T lines, as well as several bus routes: 86, 51, & 65.",
  "I believe parking is on street with permit.",
  "Contact me today for a showing.",

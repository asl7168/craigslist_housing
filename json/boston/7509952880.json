  "Hi!",
  "Looking for a roommate for a 4 bed 2 bath apartment in Brighton with driveway parking, and washer/dryer included.",
  "We have the top two floors of a 3 story house with most of the bedrooms upstairs and the common spaces downstairs \u2013 there is plenty of space so it doesn\u2019t feel like you are living on top of each other.",
  "We even have a workout room!",
  "The Washington @ Lake Street bus stop is a 3 minute walk from the apartment and it takes about 25 minutes to get to downtown.",
  "There is also tons of green space in the area with the BC campus, Rogers Park, and EF Language School all surrounding the apartment.",
  "We are looking for a pleasant roommate to share a home with!",
  "The landlord requires all 4 tenants to be on the lease starting September 1st, 2022 and ending August 31st, 2023.",
  " He does not do subletting.",
  "If this is what you're looking for, please email to set up a conversation over facetime or zoom to proceed.",

  "Our family is looking for the right set of renters to enjoy our rustic lake house in Methuen, MA.",
  "The house is 5 beds/1.5 bath, with an open-plan first floor, simple kitchen, washer/dryer, and lots of character.",
  "First constructed in the 1930's, the house retains its rustic charm with exposed stonework, wooden beams, and stone walls along the property and lakeshore.",
  "The house is on the lakefront, with a private sandy beach steps from the back door.",
  "The lake is small and quiet, and no gas motors are allowed on the water.",
  "There's a large grassy yard to enjoy, and a screened-in-porch for those who'd rather look at the water than be in it.",
  "Potential renters must be aware that the primary heating source is currently a wood-burning stove.",
  "There are electric baseboards and space heaters to supplement, but the stove is the primary heating source.",
  "If the current heating system proves to be a significant impediment to renting, we are considering installing mini splits to make the colder months easier.",
  "The house is being rented furnished.",
  "We're making a few improvements before the rental period, but the pictures are a fairly accurate representation.",
  "Unfortunately one of the family members is severely allergic to domestic pets, so we're unable to accept pet applications.",
  "If you're interested in this property, please reach out to set up a viewing.",
  "There are multiple family members who live nearby, and we're looking forward to helping renters navigate any questions that arise.",
  "Thanks!"

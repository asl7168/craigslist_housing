  "Currently the house is still being worked on, mostly cosmetically in the form of paint, overdue maintenance and light renovations.",
  "The house is presently occupied by three tenants who will all be moved out by the end of September, so it\u2019s more than liveable as-is but I\u2019m making it better every day before I leave for my walkabout.",
  "With that being said, I\u2019m considering this a \u201csoft listing\u201d to gauge interest and get the ball rolling meeting people who may be interested in renting the house while I\u2019m traveling.",
  "If you are genuinely interested I would be happy to offer a FaceTime or WhatsApp walkthrough and conversation regarding the home.",
  "I have intentionally not included photos of the bedrooms out of consideration for my tenants privacy but photos will be made available if interested.",

  "We had contacted three other brokers/realtors (one or two from very large agencies) about viewing the unit, and Naya was the only person to follow up and get us a viewing.",
  "Having rented in Boston for almost 8 years, I can truly say Naya has been the best broker/realtor who I\u2019ve worked with.",
  "Naya communicated with us through email, text, and phone call and was reasonably responsive.",
  "I appreciated that Naya would email us with updates and details, and let us know when she would be available.",
  "She drove back and forth from our old place to pick up and deliver paperwork which was totally beyond expectations and made our lives much easier!",
  "Naya was in communication with the owners and their rep, relayed us only the relevant information to us, and relentlessly advocated for us -- even when we weren't prepared to advocate for ourselves.",
  "During a really tough year, and with me unemployed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the rental and lease process was longer than average and required more paperwork.",
  "Naya handled all of this with ease and provided us with reassurance along the way.",
  "We are immensely grateful and have been enjoying our new home, which couldn\u2019t have happened without Naya!**"

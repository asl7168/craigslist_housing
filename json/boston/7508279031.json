  "We are three young professionals (2 m 1 f) looking for a fourth (preferably f) to sign a lease with us in September (one year; no exceptions).",
  "Who we're looking for: a person who is friendly and clean.",
  "We don't care what you do, as long as you pay the bills.",
  "Who we are: one of us works in pharmaceuticals, one is a writer, and one is a drone operator for a law firm.",
  "What we have: our apartment has a comfy futon, a 50\" TV, Wi-Fi, a free washer and dryer, a basement for storage, lots of plants and art, a turtle, and a porch where we hang out when we have time.",
  "We're in Oak Square, so there's places to eat and a YMCA to work out at nearby.",
  "There's also a 711, a bar, and a Dunkin' right next door to us.",
  "Despite the bar, it doesn't get too loud around here.",
  "We're all pretty busy and have our own lives, but sometimes we make meals together.",
  "We like to have company on the weekends.",
  "P.S. We don't have a parking spot (but there is plenty of street parking) and we can't have cats or dogs (no exceptions), sorry."

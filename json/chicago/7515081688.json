  "I\u2019ve lived in this beautiful apartment for two years.",
  "It is a perfect place for graduate students, undergraduates, or anyone who is looking for a quiet huge apartment.",
  "I love living here and it is only moving and wanting to downsize that is leading me to step away.",
  "I am flexible on lease date: ideally someone who can move in  by September 1 would be ideal.",
  "I am flexible.",
  "It is on the third floor and very quiet.",
  "By far one of the nicest places I\u2019ve lived in Chicago in over 10 years.",
  "It\u2019s a two minute walk from the beach, and while it is furnished, I\u2019m happy to leave any furniture that you want.",
  "Rent does not include Wi-Fi or utilities, but it is pretty economical on that front.",
  "My lease is up next July: I would get your name on the lease."

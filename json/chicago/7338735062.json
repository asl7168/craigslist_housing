  "Recently updated and in the heart of Logan Square, this vintage and spacious high 1st floor 2 bed/1 bath has in-unit laundry in a dedicated sun room with storage!",
  "Bathroom completely redone last year, and kitchen appliances have all been recently upgraded to stainless steel.",
  "Location CAN'T get any better just steps from the underground Blue line Logan Square stop and around the corner from Logan's diverse restaurants and shops.",
  "The unique floorplan includes a large bay of windows in the spacious living area, original woodtrim throughout the unit, a separate dining room with beveled ceilings, and a large kitchen with lots of cabinet and counter space (did we mention the private back porch overlooking a shared green backyard with firepit?).",
  "Pet friendly on a case-by-case basis with your choice of a fully refundable pet security deposit, or a nonrefundable small monthly pet rent (between $25 - $75, depending on size).",
  "A fully refundable (plus interest) security deposit of 1 month's rent means that your unit will be maintained promptly while you are living in it.",
  "Building is owned and managed by a small local landlord who has lived in and loved Logan Square for decades.",
  "Feel free to ask our friendly and knowledgeable management team any questions you have about the unit or the neighborhood."

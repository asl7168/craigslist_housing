  "Many renters think they don't have enough money to buy a home/ When in reality, if you are paying around $1700/month or more for rent, then you may be able to qualify for a mortgage and buy a home!",
  "Owning a home has so many benefits, one of them being having your monthly payments go towards something valuable as you gain equity in your home.",
  "When you are renting, your money doesn't benefit you at all; it's just making your landlord richer.",
  "If you are considering purchasing a home, please feel free to send me an email and I'd be glad to help and walk you through the process.",

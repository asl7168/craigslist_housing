  "This is a charming traditional craftsman in Rockridge - Fairview Park with a brand new to-the-studs remodel of the entire kitchen and both bathrooms.",
  "The house has traditional oak floors with inlaid borders on the main level, built-ins, the original fireplace in the living room, and high ceilings with craftsman beams.",
  "Numerous windows on all sides and skylights on both levels create a feeling of air, space and light and the master bedroom has a peak-a-boo view of the bay.",
  "Craftsman charm is paired with a brand-new kitchen with all new appliances, brand new bathrooms, and transitional tile that offers a modern nod to the classic roots of the house.",
  "The front of the house is framed by a redwood on one side and a Gingko tree on the other with offstreet parking.",
  "The location is highly desirable on a street with no through traffic.",
  "Whole Foods is a 3 block walk away, Rockridge and Elmwood shops are 5 blocks away, two different BART stops are each 10 blocks away, and the UC Berkeley campus is less than a mile away.",
  "Temescal and downtown Oakland are easy bike rides.",
  "This is an excellent location with excellent bike and walk scores.",
  "The house is in the desirable Peralta elementary school catchment and is just a block from the Escuela Bilingue.",
  "The pictures were taken right before the remodel three years ago.",
  "This home is available starting in June (flexible).",
  "Pets possible for additional fee."

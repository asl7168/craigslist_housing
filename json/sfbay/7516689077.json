  "Super convenient location and not too close to the freeway!",
  "A one bedroom/one bathroom unit of a beautiful duplex/triplex is opening up in an awesome location around 30th and San Pablo on the Oakland/Emeryville border.",
  "You can call this area West Oakland or Emeryville (according to geomaps).",
  "The unit is floor level, with easy side gate access and an abundant back yard.",
  "It has a clawfoot bathtub and a built-in pantry.",
  "It's retained a lot of its character and is spacious, with good lighting.",
  "The ceilings aren't too high, so if you're 6'8\" or above, this is not the place for you, unfortunately.",
  "The unit could come mostly furnished or unfurnished, up to you.",
  "All utilities are included in the rent, except for internet.",
  "Year-long lease strongly preferred.",
  "Move-in date is flexible but I prefer to have the lease start by the end of the month at the latest.",
  "I'm the landlord who would be living in the top unit with my friend who has two mellow cats.",
  "We are both quiet and conscientious so you would not hear stomping above you.",
  "Also, your unit would be facing the back of the house so you don't have to deal with any street noise.",
  "The community: I hope for this situation to be a communal sort of arrangement for all the occupants so we could get to know each other as neighbors.",
  "We'd all share the backyard which is abundant and already teeming with vegetables.",
  "I would love it if you have any background in DIY, gardening, etc.",
  "This home is a great location that affords privacy and community the way it's set up.",
  "Near Macarthur, 19th St Bart, 12th st Bart, and West Oakland Bart!",
  "Even near the Amtrak station so you can go straight to San Jose.",
  "I also heard that San Pablo is going to be repaved (or is in the works), so you'll be able to witness some changes to this up-and-coming neighborhood.",
  "Please let me know if you're interested",
  "and I'm happy to arrange a showing in person.",
  "Covid-vaccinated applicants only, please.",
  "If after the viewing you're still interested, I would do a background check and ask for references.",
  "Move-in will require a security deposit and one month's rent."

  "Incredibly private, serene setting for this single family home perched high above the city, yet within minutes of everything.",
  "This highly unique home is unlike anything else you have seen in San Francisco.",
  "The views alone are worth the visit and can be enjoyed from all points of the property.",
  "A meandering path leads down through the Zen garden and past the small tea house, perfect for home office use, sets the stage for this tranquil and nicely updated 3 bed 2 bath home.",
  "Featuring hardwood floors, updated kitchen and baths this is a must see property if you are looking for a quiet retreat in the middle of the city."

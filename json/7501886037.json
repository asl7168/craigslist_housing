This redevelopment of the former Best Brewing Company created 77 unique, award-winning loft apartments from a 9-building site. Studio, 1 and 2 bedroom residences are featured and each unit comprises a special one-of-a-kind design with lots of character and exposed brick. Many of the units have tall, wood-beamed ceilings. All of the units were recently rehabbed with sleek new kitchens and bathrooms. Building amenities include a great exercise room and laundry facility and two roof-decks featuring sunning and lounging furniture, eating tables and oversized grills.

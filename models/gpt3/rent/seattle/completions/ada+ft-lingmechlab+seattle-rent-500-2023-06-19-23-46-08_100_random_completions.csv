After that, head downtown or work remotely from the modern co-working spaces right here at home. Evenings and weekends can be spent in the theater, the game room or maybe the indoor/outdoor lounge that allows for entertaining in the chef’s kitchen or grilling and dining al fresco, all within just steps. It’s the perfect environment for hosting, but also the ideal place to kick back and enjoy some you-time. MLT (Mountlake Terrace) is a residential hideaway just north of Seattle that feels as connected as it does secluded. While being just minutes from work or play in Downtown Seattle, it’s soon to be home to its own Light Rail stop (right next door) but just as close to wooded walks and greenery.

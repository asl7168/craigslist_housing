Garage parking available for additional monthly charge based on availability. Springing up in 2020 along the rapidly-growing Milwaukee Avenue corridor in River West, this newly constructed apartment complex is designed with luxury aesthetics to create an exceptional living environment. Premium quality amenities abound including a cinema lounge with 85” flat-screen, rooftop party room with demo kitchen, grills, and alfresco dining, state-of-the-art fitness center, business center and co-working pods, and an outdoor sun deck with a resort-style pool. The unit stylings reflect the industrial and artistic character found throughout the River West neighborhood with a mix of brick and graffiti murals along with creative high-end furnishings and accessories. These chic apartments have a mix of exposed loft-style elements along with modern elegant touches. Each unit is outfitted with luxury finishes including plank wood flooring, stainless steel appliances, quartz countertops, marbled tile back splash, deep soaking tub, walk-in closets, floor-to-ceiling windows, Nest thermostat, full size in-unit washer and dryer and gas stove. Select units also include balconies and double sink vanities. River West is a quieter micro neighborhood that straddles the northwest tip of downtown Chicago and the eastern entrance to the greater West Town cluster of neighborhoods. Location, location, location is the key appeal to River West, as it is surrounded by other popular neighborhoods including River North, Fulton Market, West Loop, Ukrainian Village and Wicker Park. It is extremely convenient for commuters being about 10 minutes from the Loop via CTA Blue Line train, 66 Chicago and 56 Milwaukee bus routes, the ""Hipster Highway"" protected bike lanes on Milwaukee Ave, or car. CTA Blue line train station and bus stops are a 1 block walk from your front door. Drivers will also love that access to I-94 is right across the street for northbound destinations, and the southbound ramp is also less than 5 minutes away. Enjoy a quick stroll to local eateries such as Windy City Cafe, Pie-Eyed Pizza, D'Agostino's, Twisted Spoke, Opart Thai House, Piccolo Sogno, Maillard Tavern, and The Dawson. Grabbing a cup of joe could not be easier with Big Shoulders Coffee and Dunkin Donuts just around the corner. The beloved neighborhood watering hole is right next door at The Matchbox, and it is one of the most unique in the city as it may be the smallest bar in Chicago, but there is plenty of outdoor seating along side an actual vintage train car. Wandering down Chicago Ave, Milwaukee Ave. or Grand Ave. you'll stumble upon art galleries, independent boutique shops, craft brew pubs, wine bars and diverse cuisine throughout the neighborhood that make River West a cozy pocket of Chicago with lots of character. Daily essentials are also close by at CVS, Jewel-Osco, and BWS Beverage. Convenient services accommodate your daily needs on-site too including a front desk concierge, 24-hour maintenance and property management, package service, and a coffee bar. Parking garage is available with additional fees. Cats and dogs are welcome (with some restrictions) with a dog run and pet washing station on site to keep your fur babies active and clean.

Bright, open-plan 1 bed/1 bath 950 sq. ft space available in Bucktown, one of Chicago's hottest neighborhoods. Walking distance to the Western Blue line (.5 miles), with nearby shopping (Target, grocery stories like Jewel-Osco & Aldi's, adorable upscale boutiques, quick access on Armitage to the 606 running/biking path, etc.). If you like to be within walking distance of nightlife & cafes, without having it interrupt your quietude and sleep, and walk around the corner in the morning to brunch at adorable cafes (Red June, for instance), this is one of the best locations in Chicago. Easy 5-minute drive to 90/94 (the fastest way to skip traffic to get out of or through town). We renovated the apartment in 2014. The kitchen has a pretty, arched entrance and is modern, sunny, spacious; gas stove & dishwasher. Hardwood floors and plenty of outlets lend this 100+-year-old building a modern edge/convenience, while exposed brick and maintenance of original architectural elements maintains the space's Chicago character. Although the washer/dryer is not in-unit, it's only about 40 feet away from you in the basement below, where you will have ample storage space. If you like to garden, the front parkway and side pathway both provide that opportunity. Permeable-paved un-covered parking in back included in the rent; motion sensors throughout the property.

With its prism-like façade this new 24-story glass apartment tower reflects the increasing trend of luxury high-rise living in the South Loop. Located in the McCormick Square micro-neighborhood, renters of the 275 units here are near the sprawling McCormick Place Convention Center, Illinois Institute of Technology, and DePaul University’s Wintrust Arena. Zip to the Loop in 10 minutes from the CTA Green Line Cermak-McCormick Place station just 1 block away. Drivers also have convenient access to Lake Shore Drive, I-55 and I-90 expressways. There’s plenty to do around the neighborhood along Cermak Road, as well as adjacent Motor Row, Chinatown, Pilsen and Bronzeville with a growing surge of restaurants, brewery pubs, and entertainment venues. Culture and recreation are also nearby at the Museum Campus, Soldier Field, Northerly Island and the Lakefront Trail. Live a lush life for less with amenities that rival other downtown high-end apartments, but at a more attainable price point compared to other Loop-adjacent neighborhoods such as West Loop, River North and Streeterville. Residents here can enjoy 25,000 square feet of amenity space including a fully-equipped fitness center, yoga studio with virtual trainer, private work spaces, conference room, club lounge with pub room, game/arcade room, sports simulator room, outdoor pool deck with fire pits, grilling stations and private cabanas. Convenient on-site services are also available including dry cleaning lockers, package receiving room, a guest suite, and bike storage. Inside these apartments the warm earth tones welcome you to a soothing home environment. The uniquely styled kitchen finishes feature a mix of hues with European two-tone white and beige cabinetry, marbled light quartz countertops, gray tile backsplash and stainless steel appliances. Elements of on-trend exposed concrete ceilings and wide plank wood flooring also create a modern loft look. The floor-to-ceiling windows provide brilliant unobstructed views in all directions. Each unit also includes full-size washers and dryers, premium roller shades and keyless entry. A private parking garage is available on-site for an additional monthly fee. Cats and dogs are welcome (dog breed and weight restrictions apply), and there is an on-site outdoor dog run for your fuzzy buddy too!

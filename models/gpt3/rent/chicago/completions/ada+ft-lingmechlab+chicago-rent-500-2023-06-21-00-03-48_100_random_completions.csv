Garage parking available for additional monthly charge based on availability. Springing up in 2020 along the rapidly-growing Milwaukee Avenue corridor in River West, this newly constructed apartment complex is designed with luxury aesthetics to create an exceptional living environment. Premium quality amenities abound including a cinema lounge with 85” flat-screen, rooftop party room with demo kitchen, grills, and alfresco dining, state-of-the-art fitness center, business center and co-working pods, and an outdoor sun deck with a resort-style pool. The unit stylings reflect the industrial and artistic character found throughout the River West neighborhood with a mix of brick and graffiti murals along with creative high-end furnishings and accessories. These chic apartments have a mix of exposed loft-style elements along with modern elegant touches. Each unit is outfitted with luxury finishes including plank wood flooring, stainless steel appliances, quartz countertops, marbled tile back splash, deep soaking tub, walk-in closets, floor-to-ceiling windows, Nest thermostat, full size in-unit washer and dryer and gas stove. Select units also include balconies and double sink vanities. River West is a quieter micro neighborhood that straddles the northwest tip of downtown Chicago and the eastern entrance to the greater West Town cluster of neighborhoods. Location, location, location is the key appeal to River West, as it is surrounded by other popular neighborhoods including River North, Fulton Market, West Loop, Ukrainian Village and Wicker Park. It is extremely convenient for commuters being about 10 minutes from the Loop via CTA Blue Line train, 66 Chicago and 56 Milwaukee bus routes, the ""Hipster Highway"" protected bike lanes on Milwaukee Ave, or car. CTA Blue line train station and bus stops are a 1 block walk from your front door. Drivers will also love that access to I-94 is right across the street for northbound destinations, and the southbound ramp is also less than 5 minutes away. Enjoy a quick stroll to local eateries such as Windy City Cafe, Pie-Eyed Pizza, D'Agostino's, Twisted Spoke, Opart Thai House, Piccolo Sogno, Maillard Tavern, and The Dawson. Grabbing a cup of joe could not be easier with Big Shoulders Coffee and Dunkin Donuts just around the corner. The beloved neighborhood watering hole is right next door at The Matchbox, and it is one of the most unique in the city as it may be the smallest bar in Chicago, but there is plenty of outdoor seating along side an actual vintage train car. Wandering down Chicago Ave, Milwaukee Ave. or Grand Ave. you'll stumble upon art galleries, independent boutique shops, craft brew pubs, wine bars and diverse cuisine throughout the neighborhood that make River West a cozy pocket of Chicago with lots of character. Daily essentials are also close by at CVS, Jewel-Osco, and BWS Beverage. Convenient services accommodate your daily needs on-site too including a front desk concierge, 24-hour maintenance and property management, package service, and a coffee bar. Parking garage is available with additional fees. Cats and dogs are welcome (with some restrictions) with a dog run and pet washing station on site to keep your fur babies active and clean.

Bright, open-plan 1 bed/1 bath 950 sq. ft space available in Bucktown, one of Chicago's hottest neighborhoods. Walking distance to the Western Blue line (.5 miles), with nearby shopping (Target, grocery stories like Jewel-Osco & Aldi's, adorable upscale boutiques, quick access on Armitage to the 606 running/biking path, etc.). If you like to be within walking distance of nightlife & cafes, without having it interrupt your quietude and sleep, and walk around the corner in the morning to brunch at adorable cafes (Red June, for instance), this is one of the best locations in Chicago. Easy 5-minute drive to 90/94 (the fastest way to skip traffic to get out of or through town). We renovated the apartment in 2014. The kitchen has a pretty, arched entrance and is modern, sunny, spacious; gas stove & dishwasher. Hardwood floors and plenty of outlets lend this 100+-year-old building a modern edge/convenience, while exposed brick and maintenance of original architectural elements maintains the space's Chicago character. Although the washer/dryer is not in-unit, it's only about 40 feet away from you in the basement below, where you will have ample storage space. If you like to garden, the front parkway and side pathway both provide that opportunity. Permeable-paved un-covered parking in back included in the rent; motion sensors throughout the property.

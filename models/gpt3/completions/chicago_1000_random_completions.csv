Springing up in 2020 along the rapidly-growing Milwaukee Avenue corridor in River West, this newly constructed apartment complex is designed with luxury aesthetics to create an exceptional living environment. Premium quality amenities abound including a cinema lounge with 85” flat-screen, rooftop party room with demo kitchen, grills, and alfresco dining, state-of-the-art fitness center, business center and co-working pods, and an outdoor sun deck with a resort-style pool. The unit stylings reflect the industrial and artistic character found throughout the River West neighborhood with a mix of brick and graffiti murals along with creative high-end furnishings and accessories. River West is a quieter micro neighborhood that straddles the northwest tip of downtown Chicago and the eastern entrance to the greater West Town cluster of neighborhoods. Location, location, location is the key appeal to River West, as it is surrounded by other popular neighborhoods including River North, Fulton Market, West Loop, Ukrainian Village and Wicker Park. It is extremely convenient for commuters being about 10 minutes from the Loop via CTA Blue Line train, 66 Chicago and 56 Milwaukee bus routes, the ""Hipster Highway"" protected bike lanes on Milwaukee Ave, or car. CTA Blue line train station and bus stops are a 1 block walk from your front door. Drivers will also love that access to I-94 is right across the street for northbound destinations, and the southbound ramp is also less than 5 minutes away. Enjoy a quick stroll to local eateries such as Windy City Cafe, Pie-Eyed Pizza, D'Agostino's, Twisted Spoke, Opart Thai House, Piccolo Sogno, Maillard Tavern, and The Dawson. Grabbing a cup of joe could not be easier with Big Shoulders Coffee and Dunkin Donuts just around the corner. The beloved neighborhood watering hole is right next door at The Matchbox, and it is one of the most unique in the city as it may be the smallest bar in Chicago, but there is plenty of outdoor seating along side an actual vintage train car. Wandering down Chicago Ave, Milwaukee Ave. or Grand Ave. you'll stumble upon art galleries, independent boutique shops, craft brew pubs, wine bars and diverse cuisine throughout the neighborhood that make River West a cozy pocket of Chicago with lots of character. Daily essentials are also close by at CVS, Jewel-Osco, and BWS Beverage.

768,"Contact Us to Schedule a Tour! This is a modern 32-story tower with stylish residences inspired by the neighborhood. With unparalleled amenities and innovative services, this amazing place offers the best of everything. The historic neighborhood of Old Town is located in the North Side of Chicago. Its buildings date back to the Victorian era, but the pace is anything but old-fashioned. Old Town is lively both day and night – residents enjoy the cool, eclectic shops as well as rustic taverns along Wells Street. When you first step into the community, you’ll probably notice the iron “Old Town” sign. You’ll also discover the diversity here, both in food and culture. The comedy zone is a great place to go for a good laugh – check out the Second City or Zanies Comedy Club for weekly shows. In addition to the eclectic shops along Wells Street, residents find comfort in the local market where they can purchase fragrant spices, imported oils, and blended wines. Many family-owned restaurants reside here - from pizza parlors to steakhouses and sushi. The building and apartments are all top notch. The gym is great and has everything you need (weights, bench, squat racks, pelotons, rowing machines, treadmills, etc), the pool and outdoor decks are amazing, and the rooftop in tower 3 gives you the best views in the city. It's also a very dog friendly building with a park in the building and a larger park right outside the building.

This beautiful and contemporary residence is a great example of what we love about modern urban planning. Starting from the top, literally, you’ll enjoy a rooftop pool, sundeck and fire pit, or move down to the 4th floor terrace-style patio for a BBQ at one of the outdoor grilling stations. Inside, the amenities seem nearly endless with a club room, media lounge and game room, fitness center, yoga studio, fireplace and library. Combine this with 4,000 square feet of retail, a neighborhood Walk Score of 99 out of 100, and a 2 block walk to either the CTA Red or Brown/Purple Lines, and it’s easy to see why this property is so desirable. The building is 100% smoke-free, has a 24-hour security door staff, and coming soon, one gigabit capable Wi-Fi. Those same smart folks who designed the outside of this building also did the inside, starting with floor-to-ceiling windows that offer spectacular views in all directions. The interiors are packed with warm, contemporary finishes, including solid horizontal grain European-style cabinets, hardwood laminate floors, Grohe faucets and Whirlpool Energy Star appliances. Each unit comes with 9’ ceilings, in-unit washer and dryer, and central air. Parking is available on-site at an additional charge and there is permit street parking within walking distance. Cats and dogs are accepted throughout and there is a unique, outdoor secure dog run on-site (dog breed restrictions apply, but there is no weight limit).

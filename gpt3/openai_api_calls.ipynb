       " \"$1,100 BEACHFRONT ROOM FOR RENT (utilities included + parking space + community amenities) La Conner, WA 1 room for sublet in a 2 bed / 1 bath (top floor of a duplex with deck). Move in Sept 1 or Oct 1. Not quite Seattle, but if you don't mind the hour drive like us and you’d enjoy quiet beachfront living - this may be a good fit! PLEASE READ THOROUGHLY My husband Zachary (32) and I (Ashley, 25) are looking to sublet the second bedroom in our home on Snee Oosh bay in La Conner for the next 3-6 months and potentially longer if we find an awesome subtenant. — THE PLACE Rent is $1,100 a month. This includes utilities + outdoor parking space + community amenities. Your space includes a private room with a closet and a shared bathroom with your own sink. You also have storage space in the bathroom and kitchen, and we can make room in the front closet for shoes/jackets if desired. We also have a little extra storage space in a partial garage, which you’re welcome to utilize if needed. We are located in a small, quiet neighborhood on a private community beachfront with tall trees surrounding on three sides. The unit is newly renovated—gigantic windows / granite countertops / new trim / new flooring, etc. We have high-speed reliable internet and a breathtaking view of the bay from our home (sunrise to sunset, all visible, all year round) on the top floor of a duplex with a large deck. Our home is a modern, minimalist aesthetic (think IKEA). In addition to the beach, there is also a community tennis court, a basketball hoop, an open field for lounging or sport, multiple boat launches, a small marsh excellent for bird watching, and on clear days a striking view of the Olympic Mountains—truly an artist's muse. The downstairs neighbors are friendly, and we have open communication with them. The surrounding neighbors are wonderful and quiet. The beach is less than a minute's walk from our home, and charming downtown La Conner is not even a 10-minute drive. There are also multiple hiking trails surrounding the general area. — US (your future housemates!) In a nutshell, we like to spend our time creating and enjoying photography, working on our business, hiking/backpacking, reading, meditating, yoga, organic cooking, and holistic living. We are fine art photographers—I work from home full-time, and Zachary works full-time out of the house at present. We are quiet and laid-back by nature, early to rise and bed. We value keeping our home clean, functional, quiet, and minimal. We thoroughly enjoy socializing in small doses but prefer our personal time. When at home, we enjoy spending time in the kitchen cooking organic meals, reading, or working in our office space/reading room in the main living room. We do not have visitors over often and prefer to keep our space private in that sense. What we value most in a relationship with our housemate is genuine cleanliness, similar interests or simply compatibility, and, most importantly, a safe space of open communication free of judgment so that we all feel safe, comfortable, and at ease. No need for forced conversation or interactions either :) All in all, we’re flexible people—we just want to find someone we vibe with. I included a handful of photos of our home / views / beach / and us to give you a sense of it all. The house photos are a little outdated—the furniture setup has been filled out. Your room, the bathroom, the kitchen, and the deck are pictured for reference. All furniture will be removed from your room before you move in. We would prefer a person under the age of 40. But regardless, if you feel we may be compatible housemates (& you think you’d enjoy quiet beachfront living), we want to hear from you! Please reach out by email, and let’s chat :) If after chatting we feel like we all would cohabitate well and be a good fit, we'll schedule a time to hop on a call / video chat to get to know each other a bit better and go from there! Cheers, friends! -=>\",\n",

       " \"This is a unique situation. I am a snowbird and the past four years, I leave around the first of November and return the end of April. I have a cat that I cannot take with me, as he is an outdoor/indoor cat and he'd be eaten by Coyotes in the desert. I am offering my home at a major discounted rent in return for someone who has the time to love and care for my cat. Ideally, it would be someone who worked from home or only worked part time. The lower level of my home is a mother-in-law apartment which is rented for one year. I close off my upstairs when I am gone. I am one block to Lake Washington (Martha Washington Park) and a few blocks to the beautiful Seward Park. Bus 51 is steps away and light rail is a few blocks away (Othello Station). I require references and am very particular about who lives here in my absence. Renter pays 2/3 of the utilities. -=>\",\n",

The apartment has its own private entrance, consists of two small rooms and a bathroom, approximately 400 square feet. It comes with one parking place assigned, and access to an adjoining utility room with laundry facilites. I have rented this space out for many years, and it is an ideal location, and a fully functional living space, but it is small--so ideally suited to one person. I prefer no pets, but will consider on a case-to-case basis. This is a non-smoking unit and it is attached to my house, so it is on private property, on a dead-end cul-de-sac, across the street from a park and less than a block to the library. Rent includes all utilites at $1500 per month. First/last month required and a $500 refundable deposit, asking for a one-year lease.

       " 'Please read our whole ad. Sorry, no marketing bullet points--just real facts to help you (and us) save time in determining if this apartment fits your needs. If you are interested in touring the unit or if you have any questions, PLEASE CALL US. Calls are much preferred over emails. If we don\\'t answer, please leave a message. We will return calls in the order in which they came in . Please be patient. We try to respond to messages promptly. However, we are a busy \"mom and pop\" operation and the needs of our existing tenants always come first. That said, we would love to speak with you as soon as we can! Here\\'s some of the most important information about what we have to offer... Water, sewer, garbage and recycle utilities, reserved off street parking and storage locker included in the rent. NO ADDITIONAL CHARGES. This apartment is in the Dexter Terrace, which is an 8 unit, 1980s building situated on the side of the hill above Lake Union. It is in the lower South Lk Union/Westlake neighborhood, about 9 blocks north of the south end of the lake and less than 2 miles from the center of the downtown business district. This is a corner unit with no shared walls except for a short section on one side of the living room. It is located on the ground floor which is actually two flights below the Dexter Ave street level because of the way the building is situated on the side of the hill. Both of the bedrooms are below grade. One looks out to a large (approx 4\\'X8\\') window well and the other looks out to the lower section of a rockery about three feet away. (See the pictures of the apartment taken when it was not furnished.) The living room and deck are oriented toward the lake. In addition, there is a 100 foot green belt immediately outside the living room windows giving the apartment a relatively private & woodsy feeling considering its in-city location. Beyond the green belt there are beautiful day & night views of Lk Union, Capitol Hill, and the Cascade Mountains. The apartment is approx. 920 square feet. In addition to the two bedrooms and 1.5 baths, it has a large living room with lots of windows & natural light, a dining room, a view deck, and plenty of closets. Appliances include a dishwasher, & there are laundry facilities in the building just one floor up. Use of the washer and dryer is FREE. The address is 1738 Dexter Avenue North, which is about halfway between south Lk Union and Fremont. The rent includes water, sewer and garbage, but not electricity. There is a FREE storage locker (on a space available basis) and one FREE, reserved parking spot. The deposit is $650, $125 of which is nonrefundable. We do not collect the last month\\'s rent. We will consider cats and small dogs with good references on a case by case basis. No Smoking anywhere on the property. The building is owner managed. Current residents are all quiet, working professions. Please CALL for additional information or to arrange a viewing. Note: The attached pictures are of the exact unit to be rented. The person who lived there at the time was a professional decorator. The curtains belonged to the tenant. The apartment comes with miniblinds. The view pictures were also taken from this exact unit--either from the deck or inside the living room. I was NOT standing on a ladder on the roof of the building!

Later you can dance in evening air during a Marymoor concert or sample a seasonal flavor at Molly Moon’s (or go with steadfast classic salted caramel, it’s always there for you). Maybe tomorrow you’ll sink into your usual seat at Tian Tian or relax with a nice glass of red on the roof while taking in Mt. Rainier views. This is the attraction of Aria. It’s not complicated. It’s stylish clean design and exceptional service in the heart of Redmond at the ready to add luxury into the every day moments of life. Offering modern one and two bedroom apartments and lofts with an impressive list of amenities to enhance your day-to-day living.

We accept payments electronically (through Venmo or similar) for easy rent/bill pay. Neighborhood: Walk Score: 93 There is a grocery store located only 1 block away from the home. Wallingford features many lovely shops, restaurants, and parks within quick walking distance. Public transit is easily accessible. Housemates: Two mid-30’s medical professionals are seeking a roommate (or two) to share our rented home. We travel frequently. Non-smokers. We are quiet housemates with occasional guests, but no large parties or late night social events. One housemate describes himself as a nerdy introvert who likes games, shows, and craft beers. The second housemate is an outdoors enthusiast, well-stocked with plenty of camping and kayaking gear (potentially available to share)! We are generally low-key chill people, queer friendly, and are capable of engaging in as much or little socializing around the home as you prefer. Privacy is not an issue, as we sometimes went weeks without interacting with our prior tenant. Rent and Bills: Lease term will be Month-to-Month. Monthly rent is $1950, due by the 1st of the month. Payments are accepted via electronic transfer. Deposit will be $975, and we hold last months rent to apply when you submit 30-day notice for move-out. Application fee will be approx. $40 for credit and background check. Bills are split evenly between the number of tenants in the home. Most bills are paid only bi-monthly. Gigabit internet service is already set up in the unit. We can provide a 12month history of bill amounts upon request for your informational purposes. If you are interested, please send a bit of information about yourself, as well as any inquiries, and your projected move-in date. We are available to arrange a video tour of the unit if desired. -=>',\n",

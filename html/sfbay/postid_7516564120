***Looking for someone to start before August 12, 2022!***<br>
We are looking for a nanny/work exchange and we recognize that doesn't work for everyone, but see below what we are offering and if you are interested.<br>
<br>
<br>
The hours that we need a nanny are as follows:<br>
-Dropoff at school in the morning for our daughter - 7:55 a.m.<br>
-Pickup from school in the afternoon Mon, Tues, Wed, Thur, Fri for our daughter between 3 p.m. and 4 p.m.<br>
-Drive to and from dance class Mon-Fri after school pickup.<br>
-Meal prep school lunches for our daughter, and light house work (only vacuuming and mopping the kitchen and living rooms, plus dishes) so the total hours should not be that many per week. It ends up being about 10-13 hours per week.<br>
<br>
We are looking to do an exchange of a beautiful room for a fourth of the cost of a normal room in Silicon Valley, free food/ cooked gourmet meals, free utilities, free household supplies in exchange for a few hours of child care and driving of our child to and from school as well as to dance during the weekdays. Weekends would be off and night hours would be off. This schedule also frees up your time to do full time classes or work part or full time in between picking up our child, so you could have a very cheap living scenario and also make good money at a day job for yourself.<br>
<br>
-- <br>
About Us:<br>
We are a successful and quiet Silicon Valley family looking for the right nanny to move into our house and help with minimal tasks for our 9 year old daughter. My husband and I both work full time, running our own businesses. <br>
We are are a very peaceful and easy going couple. Our daughter is 9, well behaved, and goes to school full time (Monday-Friday) from 8:00am to 3:00pm, and aftercare at school 3:00pm to 4:00p.m., so she is out of the house all day as well. This gig is perfect for a college-age student who wants to live for relatively cheap rent in an absolutely gorgeous home, and work off a portion of their rent as a nanny. Let us help you with free utilities and food + cheap rent in exchange for some child care!<br>
Ideally, we'd like to find someone college-aged, or slightly older, between the ages of 20 and 30 years.<br>
<br>

-clean driving record (no DUI or reckless driving)<br>
-reliable and safe car that is not older than 10 years<br>
-prior experience working with elementary school age children<br>

-ability to co-habitate peacefully and professionally<br>
-no drama<br>
-be able to pay rent ($300) on time at 1st of the month<br>
-have a passion for working with children<br>
-have 2 references which we can speak with about your experience with children<br>
-documentation of the following on first day of employment: valid Driver's License, last paystub if working, or college school document proving school attendance<br>
-ability to pass a simple background check <br>
-reliable, organized and punctual<br>
<br>
Job Duties:<br>
-pick up and drop off weekdays of our daughter to and from school<br>
-drive our daughter from school to dance class and from dance class to home on weekdays<br>
-dishes daily and load dish washer occasionally if we cook a big dinner<br>
-take out trash (usually 2-3x a week)<br>
-sweep/mop just the kitchen and living room floors (usually 2-3x per week)<br>
-lunch meal prep for our daughter for the next school day<br>
-house/dog sit if we travel (usually 2-3x per year max)<br>
<br>
The House:<br>
Our home is absolutely beautiful, is well kept, and always very clean. We are a young working family and so we do not have parties or have a lot of people over often. We have 4 fruit trees in the front yard (apple, tangerine, avocado, and nectarine for you to pick whenever), a giant driveway that can fit 5+cars, and an overly large backyard with planters for growing organic fruits and veggies.<br>
The house has 4 bedrooms and 2 full baths, a spacious laundry room, a garage, a fully remodeled kitchen, and a very large living room. You will have your very own bedroom with locking door and large closet, my daughter has a room, me and my husband have a room, and I use the 4th bedroom as my office. The house is on the corner of the street, so we do not get ANY noise from neighbors or ever have any issues with anyone around the property. It is very safe and in walking distance of a school, as well as right down the street from 2 large shopping centers on Scott with Target, Panera, Mod Pizza, Starbucks, Sprouts, and about 30 other restaurants. You only have to drive 2 blocks max for all of your errands - due to the close proximity of the shopping center. It is suchhh a convenient living location!<br>
MUST like dogs and be an animal lover, because we have a few dogs who are extremely well behaved, and we consider our children lol :)<br>
<br>
The Nanny Room:<br>
The room comes furnished. We will not accept someone moving in their own furniture because we'd like to keep ours. There is a twin bed with storage built in underneath and a second twin pullout under it so you can have a guest. There is a nightstand, vanity for makeup or perfume, armoire for clothes with shelving inside, desk, desk storage, chair, a working printer/scanner, trashcan, carpet, and lamps are provided. Only thing not provided is a TV and bed sheets/pillow. The closet is very large and has lots of storage space for clothes, with working sliding doors. Room has a locking door for privacy.<br>
<br>
What You Get:<br>
--Your own bedroom and bathroom on your own side of the house (the house is split in 2 sides by the kitchen in between).<br>
--Free always available parking in our driveway (it can fit up to 5-6 cars).<br>
--Brand new washer and dryer + supply of detergent always for laundry in home.<br>
--We will agree upon a schedule that works for both of us - and we are pretty flexible people, but expect to pay $300 a month and get a room with all of the above amenities, and work about 10-13 hours per week for us (it usually ends up at 8 or 10, but sometimes we need more help in an emergency or long work night).<br>
--You get utilities 100% free, and all house hold items paid for (water, gas, electric, wifi, laundry detergent, dish soap, paper towels, toilet paper, etc.). You just need to buy your own toiletries/makeup and shower towels and bedding.<br>
--Since we all share a fridge, food is provided also for free. Feel free to buy your own too if you like certain things, but we shop at Whole Foods/Sprouts/Costco every week so there is usually a TON of fresh organic fruit, veggies, meats and snacks.<br>
--We have a home makeshift gym with: treadmill, pull-down cable machine, pull-up bar, yoga mats/blocks and ball, full rack of free weights/dumbells, kettlebells, weighted jumprope, resistance bands, and trampoline rebounder.<br>
--We also have a supercharged wake-jetski that we take out and happily will take you and friends with us if you'd like to wakeboard, knee board, waterski, or just cruise around riding the jetski.<br>
--Since you are there to support us - we are also there to support you - which means if you need us - we will be there... a ride to the ER, a ride to the airport, a spare car if yours is in the shop... we want this to be a mutually beneficial scenario for all.<br>
<br>
We want someone who can become part of our family, is experienced with kids as well as a professional, and who can stick with us at least a year -- but you are always welcome to stay longer.<br>
<br>
If this sounds like you, give us a call and we can chat to see if we all would be a good fit!<br>
<br>
Please let me know if you have any questions.<br>
<br>
Email to apply and have a great day! :)<br>

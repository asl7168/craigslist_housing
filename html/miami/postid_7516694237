Looking forward to your response:)Hello, my name is Colleen. I got out of a 12 year long abusive relationship about 7 months ago. I moved in with a friend and his mom. Had a job as a server but after about a month and a half, the restaurant went up in literal flames. They continued to pay us for 2 more months before telling us to apply for EDD. They are only giving me $88 a week because I made most of my money in unclaimed tips. I have been on the hunt for a job ever since. I found an incredible opportunity, however it doesn't start till November. I have to complete the schooling for it first. I continue to search for a temporary position but have not been able to find one yet. My friends grandmother passed away and his uncle has to move in so his mom gave me 30 days. I have tried my hardest to find not only a job but a place too for the past month to no avail. Today is my move out date and I have nowhere to go. I have to live on the streets of LA and leave my cat at my friends until I find a place for the both of us. I had a guy talk me up yesterday and offer me a room free if I help clean and take care of the kids so I stopped looking. Today he waited till 5:30 and then emailed me, ""I'm sorry. Im a pervert too."" I am a 35 year old who has never been in such a ugly situation. I am scared and desperate. If there is anyone out there who is willing to help in ANY way possible, I would very much appreciate it! I can clean and do anything else that is asked of me until I am able to pitch in for rent.

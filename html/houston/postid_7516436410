Hi my name is Levi Morlan I am a 20 year old currently living and working in Redmond as a body technician and I have a job lined out in Salem as a body technician I'm looking for a room for rent for me and my dog Turbo. He is a 6 yr old boarder Collie that is very well behaved and very good with other dogs/cats and kids. A fenced backyard is preferred but I also have a 8 ft tall kennel that I could set up for him while I'm at work otherwise he will be with me. This would be a semi temporary thing as me and my girlfriend are planning on getting a place together but we need more time to look for the right place please call or text aHello, my name is Colleen. I got out of a 12 year long abusive relationship about 7 months ago. I moved in with a friend and his mom. Had a job as a server but after about a month and a half, the restaurant went up in literal flames. They continued to pay us for 2 more months before telling us to apply for EDD. They are only giving me $88 a week because I made most of my money in unclaimed tips. I have been on the hunt for a job ever since. I found an incredible opportunity, however it doesn't start till November. I have to complete the schooling for it first. I continue to search for a temporary position but have not been able to find one yet. My friends grandmother passed away and his uncle has to move in so his mom gave me 30 days. I have tried my hardest to find not only a job but a place too for the past month to no avail. Tomorrow is my move out date and I have nowhere to go. I have to live on the streets of LA and leave my cat at my friends until I find a place for the both of us. I am a 35 year old who has never been in such a ugly situation. I am scared and desperate. If there is anyone out there who is willing to help in ANY way possible, I would very much appreciate it! I can clean and do anything else that is asked of me until I am able to pitch in for rent. PLEASE HELP ME! I AM SCARED!!!<br>

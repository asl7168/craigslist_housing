Hello,<br>
<br>
In need of a Furnished Room ASAP. I am Retired and would like to enjoy Life and relax. Rent is, of course, no problem. I just keep seeing certain ages wanted for Rentals and I don't think that is fair. I get along with people of all ages.<br>
<br>
As for me, I keep to myself and can also be sociable. I am Open to Rent amount. I have no criminal record whatsoever and I like it like that. I am a , also, and it's for me. I don't have children.<br>
<br>
If you have a Room,. PLEASE get in touch with me. Thank You so much.<br>
<br>
Hello, my name is Hannah. I am 23 years old, clean, quiet and respectful. I am trying to get myself out of an abusive relationship and I’m looking for somewhere asap. I have 1 cat who is very clean, sweet, and non destructive, a bearded dragon, and 3 tree frogs, none of which smell as I keep them and their enclosures/areas very clean. I currently am a cashier at CVS so I’d be able to transfer to any CVS Store if a transfer is necessary. I can pay probably $800/mo. max after rent and all utilities. I have my own transportation as well.<br>
A little about us - we are in our late thirties and early 40s... As a couple we've been together since late 2019, we're grown (meaning when we fight it's talking-not screaming, which is why we get along so well) we're not on and off, in and out, drama causing people. Really. Not big drinkers or partiers outside of an occasional beer at home(But we don't mind noise! We usually play music in our room as background noise at a appropriate volume), We like to do our own thing, big homebodies, we get real serious when playing our own version of UNO 😂, LOVE weed but we do try and be respectful! Usually only smoke in our own room (IF allowed, otherwise are happy to go outside or take a walk to smoke), we are just real happy doing things with each other, LOVE to cook and actually enjoy cooking for our roommates/friends when the opportunity arises, but also like doing our own thing...<br>
<br>
We aren't opposed to roommates but after the last 3 attempts have found that the roommates had higher expectations of us... One wanted friends more than roommates and found it very upsetting that we didn't want to party or drink with him anytime he had a night off (which was most nights); the next roommate(current situation) expects us to pay for his house repairs and pay a contractor to come fix his house(without giving any deduction on rent fees- which is really besides the point because there isn't anything going wrong... We've gotten to the point of thinking he might have a drug problem as he is up all night, asleep for 14 hours at a time, and has started cutting holes in the walls looking for i-don't-know-what and if the dirt rings on him are any indication, he hasn't showered in a while... On that subject there's no hot water for 3 months now because he took the water heater apart as well)<br>
<br>
<br>
It's just been a lot... I'm not gonna act like we're perfect people... I'm flawed as hell... But we do our best and when we fall short we own it and try to fix it when possible... You don't have to worry about food going missing, because we're grown and know that even though we may not know who's ice cream is in the fridge... We know we didn't buy it and that's the only thing that matters (Can you tell food theft has been an issue? 🤣 I'm a fatty, I LOOOOVE my food and love sharing it!! I just can't stand coming home after looking forward to what should be there and then it's just gone 🤬 so trust me when I say I'll always ask first before taking anything 😊) We also do our best to contribute to the household needs- cleaning, mopping, taking out trash, etc... Pay fair portions of any shared electric/water/WiFi/etc bills...<br>
<br>
<br>
I just feel like everything has been so chaotic these last few years and we just want to get to stability and it seems like the biggest roadblock has hands down been the credit- My credit is HORRIBLE. I'm talking I haven't even TRIED to fix it... I know I should but we're all coming out of this COVID mess and it's just not in the cards at the moment. My boyfriend however, has much better credit, he's been able to start working with a credit agency to fix it and it's starting to really see results although it's still not the best... I am in low 500 range but I believe he is in the 600-625 range?<br>
<br>
Now that's not to say we're not willing to compensate, meaning we will GLADLY pay a higher/double deposit to make up for it... We just haven't found the place willing to work that... but maybe you have/know if a place that will?<br>
<br>
*(Also we have no evictions between us)*<br>
<br>
<br>
We're both working, I get paid under the table but he has a full time 9-5 of many years with his family's company, between the two of us we make about $4-5k a month...<br>
<br>
<br>
If we could find something just for the two of us we would love anything from a studio/granny flat to a 1 or 2 bedroom, a little side yard or spot where we could build/plant a garden so we can start growing vegetables would be HEAVEN... $1600 or under, we just have one car so parking would be cool but if street parking is reasonable then that's fine, AC would be awesome but not a deal breaker....<br>
<br>
<br>
The only deal breaker would be having a kitchen-as in a full size fridge/freezer, stove &amp; oven... Cooking is one thing we won't budge on- we love cooking and trying new recipes so an oven/stove is a must have... But honestly we're open to whatever outside of that! So maybe you have a place for us? Maybe a unique situation? Short term? (Would prefer longer term-hence stability😋) Also if utilities are included we are willing to pay more than $1600, I'm just throwing that out there as the highest I would prefer to pay lol...<br>
<br>
<br>
my point is if if what you offer is outside of what I'm asking... Try us! Even if it is a roommate situation-maybe you are one of the few who gets what we're saying here and need some like minded people in your house? We aren't against the roommates scenario, but we just want to make sure everyone is on the same page with expectations this time around ☺️ I know a stress/drama free home is possible and that's our goal 🙏<br>
<br>
<br>
So PLEASE! Reach out if you've got something😊 oh and we don't have any pets but I'd be lying if I didn't say we look forward to the day where we land somewhere that we would be allowed to get a puppy- but we won't try and sneak one in without clearing it with appropriate parties firstHi my name is Dominic garcia I’m 28 years old, I am a heavy equipment operator trying to relocate to San Diego or surrounding areas. I’m looking for two rooms. I have a friend who works at a hospital in San Diego who also is in need of housing by September. I have money saved up and I am open for even temporary living. I’m pretty laid back I like to go to the gym,hikes and the beach.I’m also taking online classes for project management and home inspection. I’m coming from Grover beach ca. Grover is awesome I just want to be closer to friends and family and try something new.<br>
I’m a 55+ responsible, accomplished, educated that is looking for a comfortable living space for the month of August. Palm Springs. Palm Desert will work. I have local references and at one time had a wedding business in the area.<br>
Will be moving to my home in Marina Del Rey in September. I’m quiet, considerate, do not drink except for an occasional beer with my Mexican food. I eat mostly salads and don’t cook stinky food. I walk and/or swim in the morning. Usually in bed by 8:30 pm and up by 5am. I have a 10 year old small dog that is the perfect gentleman. Like me, he’s quiet, barks rarely, and only wants to be by my side. He doesn’t destroy anything or use the house as a toilet. housemate only please. Thank you."

The room is about 8ft6in x 12ft with a large closet. Room also gets Pretty nice sunlight later in the day throughout the year if that matters to you. Photos show a full bed to give you a sense of scale.About Apt/Neighborhood4th floor Apt in 6 story Apt building with elevator and common garden area on 2nd floor roof top. With Central air and heating which can ramp up utility cost if over used. Apt is little on the old side but everything works fine. Apt is close to the overpass and there is noise that is but not too bad when windows are closed. The room itself is virtually silent and on the other side of Apt from my room. Also there is an option to add washer and dryer. I just couldn&#39;t justify the cost myself though.About 10 to 15min C, G and R train stops towards Fulton Street. It&#39;s about a 2o min walk to Dumbo and F York street Station. Also 5 min walk to Navy Yard Ferry(Nicest public transit in the city).Citi Bike is across the street and there is plenty of space in the living room to store a bike if you are more Brooklyn based. Nearby Flushing bike routes go straight to Bushwick and Williamsburg.Pharmacies, restaurants, corner stores of all types close by. Closest large grocery store is Bravo and Key Foods is a little further down myrtle. Also there are 2 laundromats about 2 or 4 blocks away.

I do prefer someone with a solid 10-6 kinda job and a good credit score. Open to others we would need to just discuss schedules.

Hello Craigslist folks! As the title states, my pup and I are looking for a room. We are both fully vaccinated, a pleasure to be around, and, thankfully at least one of us is gainfully employed. We both love the outdoors, I love bicycles, computer stuff is kinda exciting, punk, metal, bluegrassy stuff, ACAB, anti-authoritarian, BLM, LGBTQ positive. If any of this sounds compatible, let me know!<br>
<br>
<br>
Psychologist seeking temporary housing while house search in Eugene.<br>
Home owner in Utah and just sold home in Colorado. Good with houses and gardens~<br>
Very responsible and caring to animals! Sweet dog is with me and would enjoy a fenced yard. If now, will walk her.<br>
I have local references!<br>
May need a place by the end of August.<br>
Happy to caretake! I see clients online, 3 days a week.<br>
Thanks for passing the word along.I'm a quiet, responsible retired who lived in Eugene for twenty years and is moving back to be near my daughter. I'm a vegetarian, don't smoke, like pets but don't have any of my own. I'm seeking semi-private share, ideally with my own bathroom.<br>
Hello! We’re Stacey and Jesse and we’re moving to the Eugene area this fall. We’ve settled on Eugene because of its proximity to friends locally, in Portland and southern Oregon, plus the great access to rivers, trails, mountains, and the coast. Of course, it’s nice to be close to some culture, restaurants, markets, etc., too! We love spending as much time as we can outside, be it on rivers in our drift boat, fly fishing, camping, or hiking. At home we like cooking, reading, writing, painting, fly tying, and other hobbies. We met while living in southern Oregon years ago and have missed the beauty of the state ever since we left. So, after a couple-year hiatus, we’ve decided to move back.<br>
<br>
We are both in our mid-30’s and are financially stable. Stacey works for an Oregon-based environmental non-profit, protecting forests and waterways in Oregon. Jesse has recently moved on from a decade-long job to pursue some writing and freelance work.<br>
<br>
We’re looking for a small, two- or three-bedroom house to rent starting in late-September, October, or November. Off-street parking for our boat (on a trailer) and at least one other car would be ideal, though we can be flexible. We have no pets nor children and both of us will be working from home for some or most of the time. We are capable yardworkers as well and would love some outdoor space at our new home. Save for a small dinner party now and then, we’re quiet and clean. We communicate well and are respectful of neighbors and community members. References from former landlords, colleagues, and friends can be easily provided if you like. Though we’re looking at the greater Eugene/Springfield area, we are flexible in the location; more rural places, if the right fit, could work for us too! Our target monthly rent is $1750.<br>
<br>
Please contact us through the craigslist email and we’ll get back to you as quickly as we can. We’d be happy to connect over phone, Facetime, Zoom, or something like that if you like. Thanks for reading and we look forward to chatting!Im a young 53 year old. Im temp disabled. Have a lawsuit from a surgeon who butchered me in 2016 so ill have $ soon. Im a heady laid back ex sous chef, I have a food truck menu for when my settlement $ comes in. Im mechanical, can fix cars,build a house, musical, peaceful, serious, funny, dorky, east coast transplant, weed advocate, and solid friend to those who are solid to me.<br>
I have disability income so I have about $550 a mo to work with do smoke herb and I eat organic, healthy, zero sugar and no deep fried foods I just lost 50 lbs due to habits like healthy fats and rethinking my rich chef menu mentality. I will gladly inspire you with light foods flavors lots of garlic and lemon and cilantro, asian flavors etc. Anyway, want to know more hmu.<br>
🙏🤘✌<br>
No pets in an apt atm but love all animals!<br>
Be peaceful and you will receive peace in returnHello. My name is Fatma and I am posting this in hope to find a room in a safe living environment. I was working in Milwaukie/Portland back in April in homecare and with Terra Staffing. I live in Pakistan but I travel back to PDX once a year. I work for Integrity Elder Care in homecare so my work is flexible. My work schedule would be mixed consisting of morning shifts/ evening shifts and possible overnights depending on if I accept an emergency shift. I will also get temporary work with Terra Staffing Agency. My intend is to basically work , when I am not working tending to my immigration situation, and if there is time then renewing my CNA license.<br>
I anticipate to travel the first week in September . I only need a room for 3 months with possible additional 1 or 2 weeks because I am currently 4months pregnant and I want to return to Pakistan to have my child. I also have a daughter who is 14 months old, but she will be staying with my husband and mother in law while I am gone.That being said I do not intend to have any guests over. I am not a smoker nor do I consume alcohol.I rarely listen to music , I do not rarely watch tv since I do not have one nor do I have the interest or time. I do not have any criminal record therefore i am comfortable submitting to a background check. However my credit is horrible mainly due to medical bill and possibly my university bill and since I mostly reside in Pakistan I have not been able to improve my credit score. Despite that I am able to pay my rent and have rented in the past; I have had a 12month lease in North Dakota and also a 6 month lease when I lived in Beaverton.<br>
I just pretty much keep to myself. I do have my Moderna vaccination card and I have never had covid. Please if anyone would be able to help me then I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you.My name is Anthony, I'm 18 years old, and I'm looking for a place to stay while I study at Chemeketa. (preferable a place within walking distance)<br>
- Considering my current living space, I'm a spotless person. My belongings are all put away, and I take pride in cleaning<br>
up my space before leaving a room.<br>
- I don't drink, smoke, or do any drugs, although I don't mind sharing my space with someone who does (as long as they<br>
are private when smoking) nor mind sharing space with pets that are well kept.<br>
- My money for rent relies on grant money (presumable $1000 monthly) and the money I'll make<br>
from working. If any problems occur and I may not be able to pay rent I will make sure to communicate with you.<br>
- I get up between 5-7 am and go to bed between 9-10 pm (depending on my schedule)<br>
- I know how to do laundry, iron clothes, mop, sweep, fold clothes, and most other skills that come with being on my own, and I don't have any problems helping out to ensure that everyone is satisfied with the living space.<br>
Thank you!I’m looking for a serene place to park my small, 15-ft. camper trailer, where I can stay in it a couple times a month to retreat from my downtown Portland condo. Just looking for quiet. I don’t have a ton of money to spend each month, which is why I’m not parking it at an RV park. So hopefully there’s someone who’s willing to be super special and kind and allow the camper trailer to unobtrusively sit in a small corner of their property. I’m a considerate, respectful, quiet, kind and fair person.<br>
Looking for a room to rent in a household in the Gold Beach, Port Orford, Bandon, or Coos Bay area. Self-employed, semi-retired. No pets. No vices. Very quiet, polite, and respectful.I'm hoping to find a perfect shared living situation. Everything has gotten so expensive that it has almost become imperative to have a roommate.<br>
I am a 64 year old currently living on the Southern Oregon Coast but find myself needing to move back to Portland to be near my elderly parents to help assist them.<br>
I currently am receiving my social security benefit ($1800/mo) and working part-time. If I move back to Portland I'd get a part-time job to earn an additional income.<br>
I'm intelligent, educated, long history of leadership roles when working. Have been working in guest services roles over the last couple of years.<br>
I previously worked in Property Management and also have excellent rental history. I have lived in the same place at the coast for the last two years, have never been late with a rent payment ($1100/mo) and my current landlord loves me and I know she'd give me an excellent reference.<br>
I'm hoping to find a living situation where the person owns their home or condo and would like a mature, stable, incredibly clean person to share their home. Preferably I'd like to have my own bathroom as well, but depending on the situation I could be flexible.<br>
I don't do drugs of any kind, don't smoke, social drinker, don't have a pet, don't entertain and am very respectful of other peoples space and feelings. LGBTQ friendly.<br>
Becoming friends would be great, but not necessary.<br>
Please reach out to me if this sounds like a potential fit.<br>
Thanks.<br>
Hello! I would like 2 bedrooms with at least street parking. $1200-1700/month.<br>
<br>
Mid 30s mom looking for housing. I’m divorcing and my credit isn’t great. My previous landlord had no issues. I work currently part time as a Certified Nursing Assistant. I plan to go to school and work part time. My son is almost 7 and going into 1st grade. He’s mellow and everyone loves him.<br>
<br>
My friend will also be living with us. He doesn’t have good credit either but is dependable and hard working. He’s just accepted a full time chef job at a hotel near Lloyd Center.<br>
<br>
We don’t smoke or use drugs or party. We have not been evicted.<br>
<br>
Open to 3,6,9,12 month leases.<br>
We have a 15 yr old cat that just sleeps and leaves no damage to property.<br>
<br>
I don’t mind paying larger deposit since credit isn’t good and I don’t have much recent work experience. (Medical stuff from 2019-2021).<br>
<br>
When replying please include pictures and a description of the property or a link where it can be viewed. Where the property is located. When it will be available and what rent/deposit will be.Hi, I'm a 28 year-old artist, writer/poet, and musician, who relocated to Portland about a month and a half ago, and I'm still seeking an affordable, stable housing situation. I work full-time doing prep-work in a restaurant so regular and reliable rent payments will be no problem for me, my price-range is ideally somewhere around 500-700 a month, so that I can not only keep a roof over my head but save-up some money as well, however: I'm flexible. I'm very easygoing, very easy to live with, and pretty quiet overall. If I'm not at work, I'm usually sleeping, reading, working on creative projects, watching miscellaneous things on the internet or going on walks, etc. I'm looking for somewhere to move-in quickly, for next friday the 12th. Hope to hear from you soon. Feel free to reply via email or text/call me. Thanks :)<br>
<br>
EDIT: I don't have a car, so please try to send me openings that are within reasonable bussing distance to the Lloyd District / Laurelhurst area where I work, I'm not sure a multi-bus hour and a half commute to and from work is a good idea (since I already work early mornings Lol). Thanks. :)

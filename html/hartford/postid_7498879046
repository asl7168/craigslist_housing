I have been renting for an extended stay and I feel so lucky to have had the opportunity to stay here. Old Saybrook is absolutely beautiful and has many spots to get great shoreline views. The house is walking distance to a private beach and resides in a quiet neighborhood, providing a peaceful and enjoyable environment. However, it is also just minutes from anything that you could need, such as lots of shopping and many restaurants. The convenience to everything makes the location ideal. The house itself is quaint and comes equipped with more than you could need! The house’s beachy theme makes you feel relaxed as soon as you walk in. There is plenty of seating and space both indoors and outdoors to enjoy. Janet has been extremely helpful and has been available for anything that I have needed. I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a nice getaway or a convenient, yet charming place to stay.<br>

Great spot on the Connecticut coastline. This quaint roomy cottage is located inside historic Indiantown in Old Saybrook. Very short walk to the beach, along with a very short ride to restaurants and a nearby mall. The cottage was very well appointed with everything your own home would have. We seldom had a desire to eat out, but available if wanted. Stayed for 1 week and wished we had booked a second week, but is was too late as the next arrivals were due the following day. Had a very nice private backyard and ample parking. Will definitely be looking to book the same cottage as our stay was very pleasant.<br>
Thank You!<br>

This small cottage is full of surprises! Once inside you are amazed at its brightness, spaciousness, hominess and comfort. There is plenty of seating and a back den/porch that is so inviting and relaxing with a large dining table…..should you decide to cook! Every day this is where I have my morning coffee. This is our 3rd summer returning to this charming cottage. It’s perfect for a couple or small family.<br>

Communication with the owner was prompt and efficient. Everything we needed was there as well as a wonderful welcome basket of treats as I was arriving very late. Location is very close to beach - the neighbors were very nice as well.<br>

Sweet little cottage in a homey neighborhood with easy access to two small private beaches. Cottage was clean and had every thing we needed for our stay. Owner was very nice and, when there was a miscommunication about our arrival time, made every effort to quickly have the place ready and gifted us a nice bottle of wine for the inconvenience. K<br>

Cozy cottage<br>
• 5 of 5<br>
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this cozy little cottage. Everything we needed and more was supplied and its close proximity to the private beach was an added bonus. The neighborhood was lovely and plenty of shopping available within driving distance. We would highly recommend Janet's property. She was very helpful and easy to work with before and during our stay.<br>

This is our second time renting this property. It is a wonderful getaway in a charming section of Old Saybrook. Close to all, but quiet and peaceful. An easy bike ride to the beach or DQ. The house is nicely furnished and fully equipped with anything you might need for a fun time at the shore.<br>

Perfect Long Weekend Getaway<br>
• 5 of 5<br>
This cottage had everything we needed for the weekend at the beach. Indiantown is our favorite private community in Old Saybrook that will keep us coming back. Thank you Janet for everything you did to make us welcome. The house was clean and well-equipped, and the beds were very comfortable. Perfect size for what we needed. Highly recommend this rental for any family that wants to vacation very close to the beach. We loved it!<br>

Can't wait to book again, everything I wanted.<br>

I highly recommend this get-away vacation rental. The cottage is clean and well equipped to make your stay comfortable. The walk to the beach is short and the beach is very clean - no liter. My family and guests that visited me enjoyed their stay. My youngest grandchildren loved the play area and beach - they played for hours (without electronics)! The cottage is also equipped with WiFi. Plenty of restaurants close by and with Water's Edge not far away there was also night entertainment.<br>

Great location, quiet, perfect getaway<br>
• 5 of 5<br>
This was not a vacation getaway. After the pipes had burst in our home back in Feb. we were forced to rent several cottages during rebuilt. Wish we were lucky enough to find this place at the beginning. Cott. was clean, all the basics provided, quiet location and only a short pleasant walk to a private beach. Owner very responsive to all our needs. Would definitely rent it as a vacation rental.<br>

Great cottage and a good location<br>

We enjoyed our stay at the cottage which provided everything that was needed for the week. It was immaculate and offered the best in accommodation for our family. It is a perfect location with the beach and shopping, etc. being close by.<br>

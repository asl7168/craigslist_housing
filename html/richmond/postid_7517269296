A 3/2 with a split layout so you can have ample privacy from rest of family. Featuring stainless steel appliances, large double-hung windows that can open from top to bottom, a bright kitchen with a skylight, modern zebra blinds in each room, a security system, and gorgeous crown molding throughout. There is a large front porch with recessed lED lighting for those cool summer nights. A 2-car driveway was recently added (another rarity). It is very convenient to take advantage of the best Richmond has to offer. House is a must see!!<br>

Hard times made me lose my house. Anyplace in OC I can rent I have a full time job and do no drugs. I'm a  modelHey! I'm 23yo, super chill, like going out occasionally in WeHo, surfing, meditating, tanning on the beach and some gym.<br>
I work in SMC and i dont drive so I'd prefer a place near there and long term aswell!. I want to live in a place with like minded people and get to meet each other well 😊 but also need my time off from people sometimes and protect my energy. Just a heads up beforehand I'm from Greece - I don't have credit score - not able to get one -.<br>
The most valid thing to check on me would be my Insta LMAO<br>
You can contact me there or my number thanks!My names Dan Gennaro. I’m originally from Pennsylvania. I’m 33 years old. Single, Non smoker, excellent credit score, model tenant with excellent rental history and references. I was all set to move in to a different apartment and they went with a close friend at last minute. So now I’m scrambling. I’m hoping to live in the Santa Monica or Venice area.<br>
<br>
I am relocating from Arizona to Los Angeles to work for a nonprofit called Jewish family services, my start date is the second week of August. I have a bachelors in communication and a master's in public affairs. I’ve worked in various nonprofits and human service organizations for 9+ years in different roles involving case management/community outreach/job coaching.<br>
<br>
I describe myself as an introvert, but most ppl who know me wouldn’t say so… my mom used to call me “friendly freedo,” cause I talk to everyone. I relax by playing my acoustic guitar, writing, hiking, longboarding, slacklining. I also enjoy natural health and wellness. I love my tea and coffee and I also like learning about the health benefits of herbs and other natural remedies. I mountain bike on weekends and I'm hoping to try surfing. Regardless of what I'm doing, I'm typically outside and on the go. Weekends I like to go camping or take spontaneous road trips to new places. I would descrive myself as being pretty open minded, laid-back, non-confrontational. I'm a Pisces so I tend to go with the flow. I enjoy meeting ppl from different cultures and background and I have friends from all across the world that have been a blessing.<br>
<br>
Month to month is what I’m hoping to find, but I’m willing to sign lease if need be.<br>
<br>
Please lmk if you’re in need of a roomate situation. We can FaceTime or meet in person. Thanks so much<br>

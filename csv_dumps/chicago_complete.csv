"The apartment overlooks the river facing west with beautiful sunsets. The space is about 650sq ft and has an open living area. Also has a full washer and dryer in the unit. The rent is $1760 plus $95 for utilities each month (total $1855/month). The utilities cover water, trash, and internet. Electric is separate and is about $35/month. There’s also heated garage parking or outdoor lot parking for a separate fee as well. The building has security 24/7 with fob entry to the apartments and has been very safe. The building also has a locked package room and full gym with free weights, yoga studio, and small indoor track with turf. There’s also a rooftop patio, grills, and a convenience store within the building. I also included a photo inside the building as it’s quite unique. I need to relocate for work but my lease doesn’t end until January 4, 2023 and I’m looking for a subletter for the space! Move in could be anytime but hopefully before July 1st!

For Quickest Response Call/Text Rachel 219-916-6499 Available 9/08/22. Pricing on 15 month lease. Utility package of $115 covers water, trash, sewage, internet, and cable. Garage parking is available for $250. All prospective tenants subject to income, credit, and background screening. If any questions or concerns, ask me! Here to help, have thousands of listings throughout Chicago, work with various kinds of credit/income! Have studios, 1, 2, 3 bedrooms throughout Chicago! Inquire! This converted loft property is unlike anything else we could show you. A three-story Art Deco building that was built in 1927 to house the Wholesale Florists Exchange now contains two floors of gorgeous and unique modern residences, plus a ground floor of retail spaces including a yoga studio. From the beautifully restored lobby to the rooftop sky lounge with outdoor deck and grilling areas, it’s thoroughly impressive. We think that the vestibules connecting select units to the main hallway and the original 1927 mail slots (now just for show!) are especially cool touches. There’s also a gym, business center and heated bike storage on-site. The building’s west loop location is convenient for commuting to both the Loop and the Medical District. The CTA Green and Pink trains are close by, as are the 90/94 and 290 Expressways. One last note about location: this property is on Randolph Street, home to Chicago’s Restaurant Row! Apartment seekers who like the “industrial feel” should love the units here. Expect soaring 11’ ceilings, large windows, exposed duct work and polished concrete floors in these open layouts. Quartz countertops, sleek Italian cabinetry, in unit washer and dryer and premium stainless appliances give each home that luxurious touch. Parking is available on-site at an additional charge and there’s also some outdoor street parking around the building. Cats and dogs are accepted throughout (dog breed restrictions apply).

Brand new in 2022, this luxury apartment complex in the West Loop is surrounded by amazing restaurants, a sprawling historic park, and several downtown businesses. Advanced levels of luxury and technology make this property stand out. In our post-pandemic world, health and wellness were incorporated in the overall plan with fresh, clean air, thanks to the ionization purification system. Also, the latch keyless entry system lets everyone come and go hands-free. Standard apartment finishes include white quartz countertops, an artistic ceramic backsplash, premium soft-close cabinetry and stainless steel LG appliances. Throughout the units, you’ll find wood plank flooring and custom built-in closets. And the bathrooms include spa-inspired glass walk-in showers. Nest thermostats come standard too. Incredible amenities are in abundance with a high-end fitness center with Technogym equipment, a rooftop deck with an outdoor pool, private cabanas, lounge seating, alfresco dining area with grills, an indoor entertaining lounge, and meditation room with private terrace. For remote workers, select apartments are outfitted with desk space, but there is also a dedicated co-working room with individual workstations and conference rooms. Then, they kicked it up a notch by adding a heated outdoor lounge. Cats and dogs are welcome with breed restrictions. There’s an on-site dog run, but you’ll also have the added pet perk of having over 13 acres of green space at the park right across the street.
